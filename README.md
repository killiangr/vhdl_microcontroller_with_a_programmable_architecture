# vhdl_microcontroller_with_a_programmable_architecture
Design of a heart microcontroller to be integrated into an FPGA. The circuit is composed of different elements. It will include memory, buffers and a core to manage all the data. This circuit must be able perform arithmetic logic functions using automata. Everything must run under Xilinx, an FPGA, that is to say a field programmable gate array. It is a hardware circuit in the form of physical chip that a user can program to perform logical operations. And it is in the memory of the latter that we will implement the necessary functions for the project
